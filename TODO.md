1. Ability to input a YouTube channel ID and retrieve all the relevant data 
(Channel name, subscribers, total video count, playlist ID, video ID, likes, 
dislikes, comments of each video) using Google API. 
2. Ability to collect data for up to 10 different YouTube channels and store them in 
the data lake by clicking a button. 
3. Option to store the data in a MYSQL or PostgreSQL. 
4. Ability to search and retrieve data from the SQL database using different 
search options, including joining tables to get channel details


## Approach: 
1. Set up a Streamlit app: Streamlit is a great choice for building data 
visualization and analysis tools quickly and easily. You can use Streamlit to 
create a simple UI where users can enter a YouTube channel ID, view the 
channel details, and select channels to migrate to the data warehouse. 
2. Connect to the YouTube API: You'll need to use the YouTube API to retrieve 
channel and video data. You can use the Google API client library for Python to 
make requests to the API. 
3. Store and Clean data : Once you retrieve the data from the YouTube API, 
store it in a suitable format for temporary storage before migrating to the data 
warehouse. You can use pandas DataFrames or other in-memory data 
structures. 
4. Migrate data to a SQL data warehouse: After you've collected data for 
multiple channels, you can migrate it to a SQL data warehouse. You can use a 
SQL database such as MySQL or PostgreSQL for this. 
5. Query the SQL data warehouse: You can use SQL queries to join the tables 
in the SQL data warehouse and retrieve data for specific channels based on 
user input. You can use a Python SQL library such as SQLAlchemy to interact 
with the SQL database. 
6. Display data in the Streamlit app: Finally, you can display the retrieved data 
in the Streamlit app. You can use Streamlit's data visualization features to 
create charts and graphs to help users analyze the data



FOR FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION:
1. try to use jinja
